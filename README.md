# Puzzle Popit üß©ü´ßüéà

A colourful, kid-friendly mobile game built with **React Native + Expo**.  
Players solve 3-4 piece shape puzzles, pop satisfying **pop-it bubbles**, then pop floating balloons before moving on to the next level. Bright colours, haptics and sound effects keep the experience playful and rewarding.

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

1. **Puzzle Phase**  
   ‚Ä¢ Drag 3-4 large pieces into the outline.  
   ‚Ä¢ Pieces **snap** when close enough (visual & haptic feedback).

2. **Pop-it Phase**  
   ‚Ä¢ A silicone-style pop-it appears once the puzzle is complete.  
   ‚Ä¢ Tap every bubble to pop it (sound + haptic + particles).

3. **Balloon Phase**  
   ‚Ä¢ Balloons float upward with gentle sway physics.  
   ‚Ä¢ Tap to pop them all ‚Äì balloons burst with particles.

4. **Level Complete**  
   ‚Ä¢ Stars, confetti and a continue button.  
   ‚Ä¢ Next level unlocks; score increases.

Key design points:

- Large touch targets & high-contrast colours for young players.  
- Positive reinforcement: confetti, stars, celebratory sounds.  
- No ads or in-app purchases in this prototype.

Open **`src/store/index.js`**, modify the `initialLevels` array:

```js
{
  id: 4,
  name: 'Level 4',
  difficulty: 'medium',     // easy | medium | hard
  puzzlePieces: 4,
  popitCount: 8,
  balloonCount: 6,
  imageTheme: 'fruits',     // must match your asset filenames
